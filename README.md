# Avengers App

This is my **Avengers App** — a simple multi-page website I built as part of my Portfolio of Evidence (POE) project for 2025.

---

## 📄 Pages

- **Home** — Landing page introducing the Avengers theme.
- **About** — General about page.
- **Contact** — Contact form that asks for **Name**, **Surname**, and **Phone Number**, and redirects to the Home page when submitted.
- **6 Avengers Pages** — Each Avenger (e.g., Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye) has their own page featuring:
  - Flip image card (front and back images)
  - Short bio
  - Power Status shown as horizontal bars filled to the correct percentage with text

---

## 🎨 Features

- **Navigation Menu:** Simple nav bar with links to all pages.
- **Flip Effect:** Each Avenger’s image flips on hover using CSS transforms.
- **Power Status Bars:** Each Avenger’s stats (Intelligence, Strength, Speed, Durability, Power) displayed as filled bars.
- **Dark Overlay Background:** A semi-transparent dark background behind the main content for better contrast.
- **Contact Form:** Simple form with a submit button that goes back to the Home page.
- **Footer:** All pages include a footer with my name and project year.

## ✅ How it works

- **Flip effect:** Uses CSS `transform` and `hover` states.
- **Power Bars:** Made with `<div>` elements styled by CSS `width` to match each percentage.
- **Dark Overlay:** A fixed `<div>` with `rgba()` background behind the content.
